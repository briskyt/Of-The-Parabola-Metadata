Explanation of my metadata:
Because my text is ~80 pages, I needed to decide which 25 pages I would choose to record, and there were two factors in my decision to choose the first 25 pages with text. First, in my experience reading math textbooks, it is much easier to read linearly because most propositions build upon one another. Moreover, even when having prior knowledge, the unique notation and conventions of every author encourages at least some reading of the prior parts of the given text. Second, the author does not include a table of contents nor sectional organization (with the exception of the Parabola its life in Projectiles label at the top of pages 53 to 72), which makes it reasonably likely that the author intended for the manuscript to be read in order. This second label in the later part of the text explains the reason for the “Section” column of my metadata, although this is unnecessary for the first 25 pages alone. For my naming convention, I emphasized the fact that the majority of the pages of this text consist of a single proposition proved in its entirety, as can be seen by my “results discussed” column of my metadata spreadsheet. As a result, I named each image by the Proposition(s) labeled on that page, or the most recent Proposition stated. I labeled the pages preceding (resp. following) the propositions by intro (resp. conclusion) and a word detailing the  The inclusion of figures is important in recognizing the author’s emphasis on geometric intuition and is highly useful for the reader in digesting the statements, so I wanted to document this. I also recorded whether a two-column proof was used because it gives insight into the format of the image without seeing the image itself, as both figures and two-column proofs take up a lot of space. The two-column proof is no longer standard in most formal mathematics, so the frequent inclusion of two-column proofs demonstrates that the text was written a long time ago. The “Results Discussed” column is included because authors citing results from the text (including the author themself) would refer to the results as Proposition X (e.g., by Proposition X, _____).  The last column aids in getting a general idea of the sequence of concepts discussed in the text, and where to find a particular result if desired. It also distinguishes the various images from one another, as otherwise the Propositions all blend together and are unmemorable. To keep things concise, I try to label these descriptions how I would explain the result to someone with knowledge of the main definitions, in imprecise terms.


Extracting and Cleaning Metadata:
My text is a manuscript, so I needed to use Handwritten Text Recognition technology. I decided to use Transkribus rather than ChatGPT, as I could more easily upload all the files at once to Transkribus, and I found Transkribus more reliable in maintaining the writing conventions of the time in which this manuscript was written. I credit this, in part, to the feature of deciding the language to a more specialized Transkribus English Handwriting M3 model for deciphering handwritten English between the eighteenth and twentieth centuries. I was having some difficulties with reading the manuscript myself, but Transkribus was able to detect the majority of the words sufficiently well that I could deduce the remaining words using context and recognizing patterns of previously translated words (e.g., noticing that the author often writes ‘s’ in a way that I, and sometimes Transkribus, would recognize as a cursive ‘f’). As a result, I would consider my experience with HTR to be sufficient as a tool to decipher the text and as a supplement to the manuscript itself. Moreover, Transkribus mostly maintained the grammar conventions and spellings of words used in the manuscript, rather than modernizing the language. Just about every sentence needed at least one or two punctuation and letter revisions, but it was close enough that I didn’t have too much work in making these changes. That said, the .txt files produced by HTR methods alone failed to be useful as standalone items, primarily due to the abundance of different fonts to denote mathematical objects, diagrams, and two-column proofs. Indeed, HTR was frequently inaccurate about the mathematical characters involved, sometimes omitting them entirely and other times getting them (especially the character ‘G’ wrong). The placement of two-column proofs was especially troublesome; the transcribed file would alternate lines between the right-hand and left-hand column, flipping the order and incorrectly splitting one line into two. I essentially re-wrote the two-column proofs. The placement of diagrams in the .txt files, especially those on the side of the text, was quite challenging to convey in the .txt files. I did my best to indicate roughly where the diagram would go by having two or three lines with just a few letters, but my depiction of the actual diagrams’ placement or features is not precise. Fortunately, while Transkribus had the most trouble with the mathematical letters, this was the easiest for me to read, as they were primarily written in bold, non-cursive handwriting. While Transkribus alone was insufficient, it made the process of extracting the text much faster than me transcribing the 25 pages of the manuscript myself.

Explanation of my metadata:
Because my text is ~80 pages, I needed to decide which 25 pages I would choose to record, and there were two factors in my decision to choose the first 25 pages with text. First, in my experience reading math textbooks, it is much easier to read linearly because most propositions build upon one another. Moreover, even when having prior knowledge, the unique notation and conventions of every author encourages at least some reading of the prior parts of the given text. Second, the author does not include a table of contents nor sectional organization (with the exception of the Parabola its life in Projectiles label at the top of pages 53 to 72), which makes it reasonably likely that the author intended for the manuscript to be read in order. This second label in the later part of the text explains the reason for the “Section” column of my metadata, although this is unnecessary for the first 25 pages alone. For my naming convention, I emphasized the fact that the majority of the pages of this text consist of a single proposition proved in its entirety, as can be seen by my “results discussed” column of my metadata spreadsheet. As a result, I named each image by the Proposition(s) labeled on that page, or the most recent Proposition stated. I labeled the pages preceding (resp. following) the propositions by intro (resp. conclusion) and a word detailing the  The inclusion of figures is important in recognizing the author’s emphasis on geometric intuition and is highly useful for the reader in digesting the statements, so I wanted to document this. I also recorded whether a two-column proof was used because it gives insight into the format of the image without seeing the image itself, as both figures and two-column proofs take up a lot of space. The two-column proof is no longer standard in most formal mathematics, so the frequent inclusion of two-column proofs demonstrates that the text was written a long time ago. The “Results Discussed” column is included because authors citing results from the text (including the author themself) would refer to the results as Proposition X (e.g., by Proposition X, _____).  The last column aids in getting a general idea of the sequence of concepts discussed in the text, and where to find a particular result if desired. It also distinguishes the various images from one another, as otherwise the Propositions all blend together and are unmemorable. To keep things concise, I try to label these descriptions how I would explain the result to someone with knowledge of the main definitions, in imprecise terms.

In any indefinite right Line, let VF be
taken equal to VG, and through the Point C in
the said right Line, draw the Perpendicular AA,
& DG.

then take the distance GC in the Compasses, and set-
ting one foot in the point F, with the other cross
the said perpendicular in the Point A. And in
like manner more points A may be found, thro'
which, and the given point V, if Curve be drawn
with an even hand, it will with the Line ACA
inclose a Space, called a Parabola, and is the

Of the Parabola
very Section of a Cone made by cutting it
with a Plane parallel to one of its sides
as shall be shewed further on. See Prop. 2.
Definitions
1. The right Line VC is called the Axis of
the Parabola, and divides the Parabola into two
equal Parts. And the Line GD is called the Directrix
2. The Point V is called the Vertex of the
Parabola.
3. The Point F is called the Focus.
4. The right Lines AA, cutting the Axis at
right Angles are called Ordinates. And that
which is the greatest is called the Base of the
Parabola.
5. That Ordinate which passeth through the
Focus, is called the Right Parameter or Latus
Rectum, as AFA.
6. The distance in the Axis from the Vertex to
any Ordinate, is called the Abcissa to that Ordinate,
so VC is the AbcissaÂ to the Ordinate CA.

7. If from any Point A in a Curve, a right
Line AC be drawn parallel to the Axis, that
Line is called a Diamater, and the Point A, the
Vertex of the Diameter. And any right Line
as CEH, which is cut by the Diameter into two
equal parts, is called an Ordinate to that Dia-
meter.
8. If through the Point T in the Curve there be
drawn the Tangent DTB meeting the Axis pro-
duced in the Point B, and TK be drawn perpendi-
cular to the Tangent DB, also VTI perpenicular
to the Axis. Then IK is called the Subnor-
mal, and IB the Subtangent. The first being
always equal to half the Latus Rectum, and the
latter always double the Abcissa.

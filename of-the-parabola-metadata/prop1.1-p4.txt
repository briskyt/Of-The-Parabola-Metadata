Of the Parabola
Proposition 1.
The Square of any Semi-ordinate CA, is equal
to the Rectangle of the Abcissa VC into 4 times
the distance of the Focus from the Vertex.
That is CA^2 = VC^2 X 4VF.
V
A
Let 1 VF = a, VC = x, and CA = y
Then by 2 CF = a s x
Construc.
and .3 FA = a + x
Lem. 47.1. 4 FA^2 = CA^2 + CF^2
1.3.4 5 aa + 2ax + xx = yy + aa - 2ax + xx
5 - aa 6 2ax + xx = yy - 2ax + xx
6 - xx 7 2ax = yy - 2ax
7 + 2ax 8 4ax = yy
That is 9 CA^2 = VC x 4VD, as was to be proved.

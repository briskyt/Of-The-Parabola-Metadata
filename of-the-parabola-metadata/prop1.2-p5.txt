Of the Parabola
5
From this Property of the Parabola we have ano-
ther Method of rescribing tha Curve by Points.
Thus, if any Abcissa be taken, and multiplyd by
4 Times the distance of the Focus from the
Vertex, the Square Root of that Product will be
the length of the corresponding Ordinate.
Or thus Geometrically.
To the Abcissa VC, and CD e-
qual to four times the distance
of the Focus from the Vertex
V
A A
VF, then bisect VD in the point
E, and on E. as a center deseribe
a Circle with the Radius ED =
EV, which will cut the Perpendicular ACA in
the Points A, A, so shall the Points A and A be
in the Curve of the Parabola.
For by Euc. 35. 3. the Square of CA is = the
Rectangle under VC and CD, but CD = 4VF, and
therefore by Prop. 1. the Points A and A are in
the Curve of the Parabola.
Note. There is no need of drawing the Whole circle,
it will be sufficient to strike the Perpendicular in the
Point A. I did it here for the sake of the Demonstration.

Of the Parabola
Proposition 10
If three right Lines be drawn from the
Focus, one to the point of contact, another
to the intersection of the Tangent Line with
the Axis, and another to the end of the
Sub-normal, they will be all equal. That
is, FA, FT, FD, are all equal.

Let 1 VC = x
Prop. 3 2 FC = x - 1/4L
Prop. 9 3 CD = 1/2 L
: 2. 3. 4 FD = x + 1/4L
Prop. 7 5 FT = x + 1/4L
Prop. 8 6 FA = FT. Therefore FA = FT = FD
as was to be demonstrated.

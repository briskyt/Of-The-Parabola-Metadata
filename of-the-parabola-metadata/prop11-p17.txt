Of the Parabola  17
Proposition 11.
If VG be drawn parallel to the Ordinate CA,
until it meet the Tangent TA in the point G;
the Square of VG shall be equal to the Rectangle
under half the Latus Rectum, and half the
Abcissa VC.
T
CA
Let 1 VG = a, VC = x, CA = y
Prop. 7 2 TV = 1/2TC, consequently
Euc. 4.6 3 VG = 1/2CA, or a = 1/2y
O 2 4 aa = 1/4yy, but
Prop. 3 5 yy = Lx, whence 1/4yy = 1/2L x 1/2x
Therefore 6 aa = 1/2L x 1/2x, that is VG^2 =
FR x 1/2VC, as was to be proved.

18  Of the Parabola
Proposition 12.
If parallel to the Tangent TA, a right
Line be drawn to cut the curve, that part
DE within the curve, will be bisected by the
Diameter AB. That is, KE = KD.
Let the other Lines be drawn
as in the figure.

Prop. 7 1 TC = 2TV
: 2 <| TAC = |=| GC
Euc. 19. 6 3 <| TAC = |=| GC : OEH
:: CA^2 : HE^2.
Prop. 2 4 CA^2 : HE^2 :: VC : VH
Euc. 1. 6. 5 VC : VH :: |=| GC : |=| GH
: 3.4.5 6 <| OEH = |=| GH
Again 7 <| TAC is familiar to
the <| ODI. Whence
it may be proved in
like manner, that <| ODI is = |=| GI
7-6--
IBKEH 8 leaves the <| BKD = and familiar to the
<| KEQ. Therefore KE = KD. Q.E.D.

Of the Parabola  19
Hence the Parallelogram KATO is = <|BKD,
For TAC = |=| GC, consequently IBAT is =
|=| GC + |=| BC = |=| GI = <| IDO, and taking
away IBKO which is common to both, there will
remain the figure KATO = <| BKD.
Lemma
If the Triangle A8C be equal to the Tra-
pezium ADEF, and DE parallel to AC. Then,
will DE + AF x DA = AB x AC
B
D E
A G H C F
Because <|ABC = Trap. ADEF, DE + AF x DG
is = AC x BH. Therefore by Euc. 16. 6. DE + AF :
AC :: BH : DG :: (by Euc. 4. 6.) AB : AD, conse-
quently DE + AF : AC :: AB : AD, and therefore
by 16.6. Euclid DE + AF x AD = AB x AC. q.e.d.

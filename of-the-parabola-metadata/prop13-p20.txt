20 Of the Parabola
Proposition 13
If it be as AG to AR, so is twice TA to a
fourth, that fourth is called a Parameter to
the Diameter AB. And the Rectangle under
this Parameter, which I shall henceforth call
P, and any Abcissa of that Diameter, is e-
qual to the Square of the Semiordinate corre-
sponding to that Abcissa, that is, P x AK is = 
KD^2 = KE^2.

Def. 1 AG : AR :: 2TA : P
Euc. 4.6. 2 AG : AR :: KB : KD
1 & 2 3  2TA : P :: KB : KD
:3 4 P/2TA = KD/KB
Lem. 5 2TA x AK = KB x KD
4 x 5 6 P/2TA x 2TA x AK is
= KD/KB x KB x KD
That is 7 P x AK = KD x KD = KD^2 = KE^2, which was
to be demonstrated.

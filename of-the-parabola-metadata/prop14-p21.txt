Of the Parabola  21
Proposition 14
The Parameter of any Diameter, is equal to
the Latus Rectum added to four times the
Abcissa of the Ordinate drawn from the
Vertex of that Diameter. That is P is =
L + 4VC.
Parallel to the Tangent TA draw VK.
Let VC = x, CA = y
Prop. 12 2 VK is a Semiordinate
to the Diameter AB
Euc. 34. 1. 3 AK = TV = VC = x
& Prop. 7.
Therefore 4 Px = VK^2 = AT^2 =
Prop. 13. AC^2 + CT^2
Whence 5 Px = yy + 4xx
Prop. 3. 6 yy = Lx
: 7 Px = Lx + 4xx
7 :- x 8 P = L + 4x
That is 9 P = L + 4VC, as was to be proved.

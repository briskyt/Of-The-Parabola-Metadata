Proposition 15
The Parameter of any Diameter is equal
to four times the distance of the Focus to the
Vertex of that Diameter. That is, P = 4FA.

F A
Prop. 14. 1 P = L + 4VT
Prop. 3. 2 L = 4VF
: 1 & 2. 3 P = 4VT + 4VF = VT + VF x 4
Prop. 10. 4 VT + VF = FA
: 3 & 4 5 P = 4FA. Which was to be
demonstrated.

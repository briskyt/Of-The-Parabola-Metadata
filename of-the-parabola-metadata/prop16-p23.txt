Of the Parabola  23
Proposition 16
If from the Focus, a Perpendicular be
drawn to any Tangent, the Square of that
Line will be equal to the Rectangle under
the diftances of the Focus from the Vertex
and from the Point of Contact. That is FD^2
= FV x FA.

C A
Draw the right Line VD
perpendicular to the Axis;
I say VD, because it will
coincide with the point D
by reason FT = FA, & VT = VC.
Euc. 2.6. 1 DT = DA
Euc. 8. 6. 2 TF : FD :: FD : FV
: 2. 3 FD^2 = FV x FT
Prop. 10. 4 FT = FA
3. 4. 5 FD^2 = FV x FA. Which was to be
demonstrated.

	24 Of the Parabola
Proposition 17.
If an Ordinate to any Diameter pass through
the Focus, the Abcissa corresponding to that
Ordinate will be equal to a fourth and the
Semiordinate equal to one half of the Para-
meter corresponding to that Diameter. That
is, AK = 1/4P, and EK = 1/2P.
T
K
AK- F.T.
Euc. 34.1. 1 AK = FT
Prop. 8. 2 FT = FA
1. 2. 3 AK = FA
Prop. 15. 4 FA = 1/4P
3. 4. 5 AK = 1/4P. Q.E.D.
Again
Because 6 AK = 1/4P
Prop. 13 7 P x AK = EK^2
: 6. 7. 8 EK^2 = P x 1/4P = 1/4PP
and x 9 EK = 1/2P, which was to
be demonstrated.

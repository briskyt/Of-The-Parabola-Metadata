6
Of the Parabola
Proposition 2
The Squares of the Semi-ordinates are in direct
Proportion to their respective Abcissas. That is,
VC : VB :: AC^2 : AB^2.
V
A C
A B
4C-y
Let 1 VF = a, VC = x, VB = X, AC = y
and AB = Y.
Prop 1. 2 4ax = yy
3 4aX = YY
Therefore 4 4ax : 4aX :: yy : YY
also 5 x : X :: yy : YY.
That is 6 VC : VB :: AC^2 : AB^2, which was to be
demonstrated.
This is that Property of the Parabola which is
immediately demonstrated from the Section of a Cone.

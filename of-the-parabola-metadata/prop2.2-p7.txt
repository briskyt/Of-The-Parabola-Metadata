Of the Parabola    7

Thus. Let the Cone DEG
be cut by a Plane parallel
to the side DE. Then the
Section AAVAABA is cal-
led a Parabola.
In which it will always
be, VC : VB :: AC^2 : AB^2.
Demonstration
P Sim. 1 VC: CI :: VB : BG.
Triangles
Euc. 16.6 2 VC x BG = CI x VB
2 x HC = 3 VC x BG x HC = CI x VB x HC
DB . . . .
Euc. 35.3 4 AB^2 = DB x GB
5 AC^2 = HC x CI
But 6 HC = BD
: 3.4.5. 7 VC x AB^2 = VB x AC^2
Euc. 16. 6 8 VC : VB :: AC^2 : AB^2, as was to be
demonstrated.
And hence we are furnished with ano-
ther methood of describing the Parabola through
Points, having given ohe Abcissa and its Ordinate.

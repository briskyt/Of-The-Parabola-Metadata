Of the Parabola
Or thus Geometrically
Let VC be the given
Abcissa whose correspon-
ding Ordinate is CA,
and 'tis required to find
the Ordinate to the
Abcissa VB.
V
A A
E
Join VA, and Perpen-
dicular thereto draw AD
to meet the Axis in D.
That done, make BE equal to CD; then bisect
VE in I, and setting one foot of the Compasses
in I, with the Radius  IV = IE, cross the perpen-
dicular BA in A. I say the Point A is in
the Curve of the Parabola.
For by this construction and Euc. 11.6 CD is = CA^2/VC
and because BE is made = CD, it is BE = CA^2/YC, and
multiplying by VB, it is BE x VB = CA^2 x VB / VC. But
by Euc. 35. 3. BE x VB = AB^2, therefore AB^2 =
AC^2 x VB / VC. That is VC : VB :: AC^2 : AB^2, as in
Prop. 2. Therefore the Point A is in the Parabola.

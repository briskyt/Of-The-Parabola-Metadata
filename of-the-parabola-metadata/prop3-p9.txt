Proposition 3
The Latus Rectum or Right Parameter, is
four times the distance of the Focus from the
Vertex, and is a third Proportional to any
AbcissaÂ and its corresponding Semi-Ordinate.
L A
A C
Let 1 VF = a
2 FL = y
Prop. 1. 3 yy = 4ax
But 4 x = a
: 3.4 5 yy = 4aa
in 5 6 y = 2a = FL. Therefore LA is = 4a
= 4VF, as was to be proved.
Again
Let 1 4VF = L = the Latus Rectum
2 VC = x, and CA = y.
Prop. 1. 3 Lx = yy
Prop 16.3 4 x: y :: y : L
6. Euc. 
That is, VC : CA : CA : LA, as was to
be demostrated. The Construction of the
Curve from this Prop. is the same as before, Prop. 1.

As the Latus Rectum, is to the Sum of any
two Semi-ordinates; so is their Difference, to the
Differences of their Abcissas.

I say, LA : DE + CB :: DE - CB : VD - VC
Let 1 LA = L, VC = x, VD = X, CB = y,
and DE = YY.
Prop. 3. 2 Lx = yy, and LX = YY
p axiom 3 LX - Lx = YY - yy
That is 4 L x X - x = Y + y x Y - y
Euc. 16. 6 5 L : Y + y :: Y - y : X - x.
That is 6 LA : DE + CB :: DE - CB : VD - VC.
which was to be demonstrated.

Of the Parabola
11
Proposition 5.
If from the Vertex V a right Line be drawn
cutting the Curve in any Point A, and any
Ordinate either within or without the Parabola,
as RS; it will be, as the Latus Rectum, is to
the Semi- Ordinate CA; so is 23, to the correspond-
ing Abcissa VR.

Let 1 VC = x, VR = X,
CA = y, RB = Y,
and RS = b.
Prop. 2. 2 yy : YY : xx : X
By Sim. 3 x : X :: y : b
Triangles
2. 3. 4 yy : YY :: y : b
Euc. 16. 6. 5 byy = yYY
5 :- 4 6 by = YY = LX by Prop. 3.
: 6 7 by = LX
Euc. 16. 6 8 L : y :: b : X
That is 9 L : CA :: RS : VR, which was to be proved.

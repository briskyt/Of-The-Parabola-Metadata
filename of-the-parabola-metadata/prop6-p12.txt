12 Of the Parabola
Proposition 6.
If any Point P be taken in the Axis produced,
and a right Line be drawn from thence cut-
ting the Curve in two Points A and B, and the
Ordinates AC and BD be drawn; The distance
of the Point P above the Vertex, will be a geo-
metrical mean Proportional
between the two Abcissas VC &
VD.
P
D B
Let 1 VC = x, VD = X, and
VP = b.
Then 2 PC = b + x, and
PD = b + X.
By Similar. 3 PC^2 : PD^2 :: CA^2 : DB^2
Triangles
Prop. 2. 4 CA^2 : DB^2 :: x : X
3.4. 5 PC^2 : PD^2 :: x : X
2. 5. 6 bb + 2bx + xx : bb + 2bX + XX :: x :: X
: 7 bbX + 2bxX + xxX = bbx + 2bxx + XXx
7. reduced 8 X - xxbb = X - X x xX
8 :- 9 bb = xX and if A and B coincide X = x, bb = x^2, b = x
: 10 x : b :: b : X Then PA is a tangent
That is 11 VC : VP :: VP : VD. as was to be proved.

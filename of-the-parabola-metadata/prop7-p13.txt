Of the Parabola  13
Proposition 7.
If the right Line TA be drawn to touch the
Parabola in the Point A, and there be drawn
the Semi-Ordinate AC. The Sub-tangent
TC will be double to the Abcissa VC, that
is, VT will be equal to VC.
T
C n a
Let 1 VC = x, CA = y,
An = x, an = y
Euc. 4. 6 2 y : x :: y : yx/y = TC.
Prop. 3. 3 Lx = yy
Euc. 3 4 Lx = 2yy
That is 5 x = 2yy/L
2 & 5 6 2y^2y/Ly = TC
that is 7 2yy/L = TC
3 & 7 8 2Lx/L = TC
Whence 9 2x = TC; therefore the Sub-tan-
gent is double to the Abcissa, as was to be
demonstrated.

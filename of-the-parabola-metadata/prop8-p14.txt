14. Of the Parabola
Proposition 8
If from A the point of contact, a right Line
be drawn to the Focus, as AF, this Line shall
Line shall be equal to the distance of the
Focus from the point where the Tangent in-
tersects the Axis produced, that is AF is = TF.
T
CA
Let 1 VC = x
Prop. 3 2 FC = x - 1/4L, and CA^2 = Lx
Euc. 47. 1 3 AF^2 = FC^2 + CA^2 = xx + 1/2Lx + LL/16
in 2 4 AF = x + 1/4L
Prop. 3 5 TF = x + 1/4L
& 7 ..
Therefore 6 AF = TF, as was to be demonstrated.

Of the Parabola  15
Proposition 9
If from A the point of contact, there be drawn
the right Line AD perpendicular to the Tang'
TA, the Sub-normal CD is a standing quantity,
being always equal to half the Latus Rectum.

Let 1 VC = VT. by Prop. 7 = x
Euclid 2 TC : AC :: AC : CD
8 & 4. 6.
That is 3 2x : y :: y : yy/2x = CD
Prop. 3 4 yy = LX
Therefore 5 Lx/2x or 1/2L = CD, as was to be
proved.
